* My template for creating documents with PagedJS

- TailwindCSS + PostCSS
- Hugo
- PagedJS
- Tied together with Make

Commands:

- make dev :: start Hugo and Tailwind servers
- make public :: build the site into public/

Todos:

- [ ] Make command to build a PDF (perhaps through pagedjs-cl)
  - Maybe that's not necessary
